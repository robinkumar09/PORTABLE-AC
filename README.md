We were a team of 5 members in that project.The portable AC project, developed in the second semester of the physics lab at IIT Ropar, involved designing a compact, energy-efficient air conditioning unit that can be easily moved and used in various settings. The project focused on optimizing cooling performance while maintaining low power consumption and minimal environmental impact. Key components included a small compressor, heat exchanger, and environmentally friendly refrigerant. The design also incorporated user-friendly controls and safety features, ensuring practicality and reliability for everyday use.
